<h1>Interpreter Commands</h1>
<PRE>

Interpreter commands are always 4 bytes (1 long)

0 sss 000c | cccccccc | ccccccco | oooooooo
 These commands specify a cluster/offset.
 GOTO             s=0      PC always changed
 CALL             s=1      PC always changed, return stacked
 BRANCH-IFNOT     s=2      PC is changed if last result == 0
 BRANCH-IF        s=3      PC is changed if last result != 0
 TOKENIZE         s=4      No room left in the VideoCOG. Overflowing here.
 STOP             s=7      PC changed to this (infinite loop)
 NOP              s=*      Anything else, do nothing

For COG commands, pointers in clusters are full 11 bits (2K). But for
interpreter commands, code must always reside on a 4-byte boundary
thus 9bit offsets.

Cluster numbers are 16 bits (64K clusters). 
A reference to cluster FFFF means the current cluster.
64K clusters * 2K bytes = 128M (minus 2K) of addressable program space.

--- CCL Parser strategy ---

Look for PROCESS. 
  Strip off left into LEFT. 
  Note PROCESS and strip it off.
  Strip off right hand side.
Look for OP.
  Strip off right into RIGHT.
  Note OP and strip it off.
What remains is LEFT
  
If there is an OP, make sure there is a LEFT and RIGHT ... UNLESS "~" and "-"
  For "~" there must NOT be a LEFT. Make LEFT a C_0
  For "-" if there is no LEFT MAKE LEFT a C_0
If there is no OP move LEFT to RIGHT and null LEFT

- If C, move C to end of list. 
- else If F, move F to end of list. Load cluster to F. 
- else If Z, move Z to end of list. Load cluster to Z.
- else return FFFF (All sectors loaded and locked down)

- Add h to lastEntry->ref
- Return lastEntry->pos

REFERENCE:
 CACHE command with h=1,r=0, and c to target cluster (usually current number filled in by CCL)

DEREFERENCE:
 CACHE command with h=0,r=1, and c=FFFF and offset to target cluster passed as usual

<h1>SoundCOG (Box 3) COG 4</h1>

The audio system has 3 independently programmable voices.

Each voice points to one of 3 loaded waveforms or a 4th waveform
that is always random values (for noise). The 3 waveforms are initialized 
to square, triangle, and sine. These can be changed with an external command.

Each voice has a delay value that controls how many voice-loops pass between
waveform value changes. The longer the delay, the lower the frequency of the
voice output.

Each voice has a volume decrease. This value is subtracted from the 
waveform values -- efectively shifting the entire waveform down linearly.

The more samples you have to pump per second, the less time you
have between pumps. Higher waveform resolution reduces your available
clocks as does higher frequency. 

Frequency production is also limited to whole number multiples of the
main loop. Fast inner loops of low-resolution waveforms gives the most
available frequency values (good for music) but poor control of sound.

Q is the number of clocks in the main loop. A waveform has N samples.
The main loop changes samples after M loops.

The waveform completes 1 cycle after Q*M*N clocks.

Freq = 80000000 / (Q*M*N)
M = 80000000 / (Q*N*Freq)

A musical note specification is really two events: a note on and a note off.
Note events come as two major parts: length and frequency.

2A0	- Means half note (2 beats) A in the 0th octave
G	- Means a G in the last used octave at the last used length
4.tC++	- Means a dotted quarter note tripplet (T) two octaves (++) above the last octave
4dC3b	- Means a quarter note double C-flat (b) in octave 3	
4G_	- Means a quarter note G held into the next note (_)

Lengths:
1,2,4,8,16,32 	Standard music beats ... can have "." and or "t/d" modifiers
If unspecified, use last given length

Frequencies:
A,B,C,D,E,F,G, and R (for rest)
Octave info, if given, follows as an absolute number or multiple "+/-".
Octave info defaults to the last used value.
Accidental info, if needed, follows as a "b" (flat) or "#" (sharp)
A trailing "_" indicates the note is held into the next note, which must be the same frequency
