* Block comments
* Rework the input cog for GC or Keyboard config
* Looking up a cluster should ignore case
* system defines for rumble
* Input Mode command (and default to keyboard if not given 1st)
* Rumble commands 
* while(true)
* ++ and --
? invalid commands show up as "Invalid number" instead of "Unknown Command"
* ReadPlayer command
* ERROR.MIX should work but the while(true) at the top does something weird
* variable a,b,c,d
* Color pick MIX program. Clean and comment it.
* Multiline commands
* Clean up the VideoCOGParser and structure commands
* Clean/comment the KeyState program
* Complex sprites need "transparent" color
* We can still use 0 as flag for no-script ... just have to mask off the cluster offset added in.
* Change sprite info geometry so that 0=8, 1=16, 2=32, and 3=64.
* SPRITE/TILE use Arguments for geometry and mapping
* ActionScript using arguments
* handle true/false (1/0) in ALL help text and in processing everywhere (search for it).
* make sure everyone uses equals("COMMAND") || startsWith("COMMAND ") and substrings here need to be 7 ... not 8.
* everywhere there is a TILE= variable add an optional COLOR=
* if( a==1 || a==2 || a==3) ... auto parenthesis
* Better error handling from exceptions in ExpressionParser
* LONG counter in memory ... counts retraces
* Instead of SIMPLE,TILE -- SIMPLEIMAGE or IMAGE
* There is only ONE pass through the parser ... change the commands that check for null for 1st pass
* Need a command to wait for retrace (to change static sprites)
## ! NOT handling in expression tree
##* Arithmetic expression tree ... no order of operation
* COLORSET INDEX=0, C0=a, C1=b, C2=c, C3=d (becomes a long write)
* PRINT commands need to preserve color set
* Document the VideoCOG commands

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

* MIX helper library for sprites

* Weird error if you accidentally put a structure in the code section
* defines for player inputs

* More complete sprite testing ... all sizes, simple/complex, num per line, etc

* Find a way to speed up the sprite-draw-loop. Maybe cache some calculations during
  refresh ... separate code for simples.



* sweep through commands and makesure N is correct in getArgument("blah",N)

* Error message for: V1=MEM[V2]

* document all system-defines in MIX.doc

* In command reference, give the ranges and defaults of all parameters

* Color of 15 means treat target tile as pointer to actual tile. Automatic tile/flipping algorithm.
  Change the videocogparser to error on COLORSET 15





* Emulator

* Web site

* Find SD cards cheap

* Write a book "Flow" about loops and if/else etc. Use a quasi-assembly discussion
  - Conditional jumps
  - gotos ... are they evil?
  - loops
  - expression trees
  - breaks/continues
  - do/while-false
