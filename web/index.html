<h1>What is the PEGS kit?</h1>
</span>

PEGS is a complete build-it-yourself TV game console system. The kit
includes a printed circuit board and all the electronic parts. Once
you have built the system you can create your own games and copy them
to the included SD card for play on the hardware. <P>

The accompanying book, <i>Build and Program Your Own Video Game Console 
System,</i> teaches basic soldering, kit construction, and game programming
in an easy-to-understand style. If you are new to electronics and programming
then this system is for you!<P>

--- Insert picture of book cover and open book with example pages ---<P>

You will need some basic tools to complete the kit: soldering iron, solder, and a pair
of wire snippers. These are inexpensive and readily available at your local
Radio Shack or other electronics store. (See the support section for online sellers.)<P>

You will also need a PC to develop your own games. You will use your favorite text editor
(Notepad works nicely) to create your games. You will use a compiler/emulator written in
Java to convert your game files to binary form playable on the system. You most likely have 
the Java runtime installed on your computer already. If not, the download is free and quick (see
the support section). You will need an SD card reader in your PC to copy your finished games
to the SD card for play on the system. If your computer does not have a multi-media card
reader installed, you can buy a USB multi-media card reader from your local electronics
store for under ten dollars. (See the support section for online sellers).<P>

You'll need a TV and a PS/2 computer keyboard to play your games. You can also hook two
GameCube controllers to the system for a true gaming experience.<P>
